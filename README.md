# Java-Text-Based-Game
The Text-Based Game is a fantasy adventure game that allows players to explore different locations and interact with characters. The game starts by greeting the player and asking for their name. The player is then presented with a main menu that offers various options such as exploring the forest, visiting the town, resting at the inn, and quitting the game. As the player makes choices and completes different actions, their health and experience points will change. The player can gain experience points by exploring the forest and finding treasure chests or by visiting the town and receiving advice from NPCs. Health points can be regained by resting at the inn. The game also includes a player level system which increases as player gains experience points. The game ends when the player decides to quit. The game is designed to be simple and easy to understand, while still providing a sense of adventure and exploration.
